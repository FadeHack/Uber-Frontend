# Uber Clone - React & Vite Frontend

 <!-- It's highly recommended to replace this with an actual screenshot of your running application -->

A modern, responsive front-end clone of the Uber landing page and ride-booking experience. Built with React, Vite, and TypeScript, this project demonstrates a complete user flow from landing on the page to booking a ride, all without a backend. User authentication and ride state are managed locally using Zustand with `localStorage` persistence.

## 💡 How It Works

### Authentication Simulation

Since there is no backend, user authentication is simulated using `localStorage`:
-   **Sign Up**: A new user object (including a mock password) is created and saved as a JSON string in `localStorage` under the key `uber-clone-user`. The user is also immediately logged into the Zustand store.
-   **Login**: The entered credentials are compared against the user object stored in `localStorage`. If they match, the user data is loaded into the Zustand store.

### State Persistence

The Zustand `persist` middleware automatically saves the entire state (user object, `from`/`to` addresses) to `localStorage` under the key `uber-clone-storage`. This ensures that:
-   A user remains logged in even after refreshing the page.
-   Ride details are not lost if the user navigates away and comes back.
